This project explores and developes the machine learning (neural networks typically) enabled discrete element method (NetDEM) for the computational mechanics of irregular-shaped particles. The conventional DEM encompasses four main steps in one typical calculation cycle, namely, (1) the detection and resolution of contacts, (2) the evaluation of contact behavior, (3) the calculation of particle motion, and (4) the updating of particle geometric descriptions. NetDEM exploits the inference ability of neural networks at two levels: level 1, which is to take particle geometric descriptors as inputs and output the contact status and contact geometric features; level 2, which is to take particle geometric descriptors as inputs and directly output the particle accelerations.
